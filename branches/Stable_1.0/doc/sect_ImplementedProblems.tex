\section{Implemented Problems}
\label{sect:ImplementedProblems}
In this section we give an overview about the implemented problems. At first we present the strong and weak formulation for the full elliptic PDE and for a problem in elasticity. There we define the spaces for the conforming and non-conforming discretizations. Additionally we take a look on the mixed formulation with the corresponding spaces. In the \FFW there are several problems and geometries already defined. In ./problems/geometries you will find the definition of the geometries, e.g. L-shape or Square, and in ./problems/elliptic (./problems/elasticity) we give some examples for a problem definition for an elliptic (elasticity) problem.
