\section{Implemented Problems}
\label{sect:ImplementedProblems}
%
%\noindent In this section we give an overview on the implemented problems. At first, we present the strong and weak formulation for the full elliptic PDE and for a standard problem in elasticity. Afterwards, we define spaces for the conforming and non-conforming discretizations. Additionally, we take a look on the mixed formulation with the corresponding spaces.

\noindent The \FFW is able to handle full elliptic problems and problems which arise from elasticity. For these classes of problems conforming, non-conforming and mixed finite element methods are available. In this Section we present the strong and weak formulation of these problems and the corresponding FE-spaces which are implemented. In Table \ref{sect:PDESolver:table:pdeSolver} all available methods are listed. A more detailed mathematical description of the presented problems can be found in \cite{Ar,ArWi,Bra,HaFaIo}.

\medskip

\noindent To get a first impression of the FE-methods, several problems and geometries are already defined in the \FFW\!. The geometry definitions are stored in \path{.\problems\geometries}, whereas the problem definitions for elliptic and elasticity problems are stored in \path{.\problems\elliptic} and \path{.\problems\elasticity}, respectively.
