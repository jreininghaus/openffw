\subsection{Installation of the FFW}
\label{sect:QuickStart:installation}
There is no need to install the \FFW\!.
As long as any script is started from the root folder of the \FFW\! the function \code{initFFW}
adds all subfolders to the MATLAB searchpath. Once any script has run \code{initFFW} successfully, it is also possible
to start scripts from any subfolder until the MATLAB session is finished. The folders are not permanently added
to the searchpath. Alternatively you can manually add the folder of the \FFW\! with all subfolder to the MATLAB searchpath.
