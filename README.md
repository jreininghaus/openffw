# OpenFFW

This MATLAB software package contains an algorithmic framework for rapid prototyping and numerical verfication of 2D (adaptive) finite element methods. The initial version of OpenFFW has been created by A. Byfut, J. Gedicke, D. Guenther, J. Reininghaus, and S. Wiedemann under the supervision of Prof. C. Carstensen at Humboldt University of Berlin. The main features of OpenFFW are:
* conforming, non-conforming, and mixed 2D finite element discretizations of
    1. linear elliptic PDEs with non-constant coefficients
    2. linear ellasticity PDEs with non-constant material parameters
* various a posteriori error estimators
* adaptive mesh refinement
* a comprehensive documentation
